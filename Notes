To add

	Discount row for Entry table
		you might need a new table for this to remove 
			the repeating 0's in a normally 0 discount day
		table contains:
			date
			discounted price
			foreign key to product
			foreign key to branch
			foreign key to entry???
			???
	window for days that have been done (calendar)
		show a calendar of what days have entries
	check
		messages.info(request, 'Successfully submitted the form for ' + date)

To ask
	views
		Ugly
			request_post.__getitem__("form-" + str(n) + "-product_number")
		Redundant
			checking for emptiness of formsets even though I already defined it in models

	validation of forms?
